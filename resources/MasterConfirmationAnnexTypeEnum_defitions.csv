In simpler terms, it's a technical term that refers to the type of agreement used when trading financial instruments that are linked to a specific interest rate index (e.g., LIBOR or EURIBOR).

The ISDA 2010 Fair Value Share Swap European Interdealer is an enumeration value that specifies the type of annex to be used when creating a Master Confirmation Agreement (MCA) for a derivatives transaction. Let's break it down:

**ISDA**: The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is a non-profit industry association that develops and maintains standard documentation for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.

**2010**: This refers to the ISDA Master Agreement 2010, which is a widely used standard agreement governing master netting agreements in OTC derivatives markets. The 2010 version replaced the earlier 2002 ISDA Master Agreement.

**FAIR VALUE**: In the context of an MCA, Fair Value refers to the market value of a derivative instrument at a given point in time. This is distinct from the notional or face value of the instrument.

**SHARE SWAP**: A share swap, also known as a total return swap (TRS), is a type of derivatives transaction where one party agrees to pay the other party the total return on a reference asset (e.g., a stock or index) over a specified period. The reference asset's price movements are replicated through the payment of the total return, which includes both the capital appreciation and any dividend payments.

**EUROPEAN**: This term refers to the fact that this specific annex is applicable to transactions governed by European law.

**INTERDEALER**: Interdealer transactions occur between two parties who are both market makers or dealers in a particular market. These transactions are distinct from transactions between a dealer and a customer (e.g., a retail investor).

In summary, the ISDA 2010 Fair Value Share Swap European Interdealer annex is used when creating an MCA for a share swap transaction that takes place between two dealers operating in the European derivatives market. The annex provides standardized terms and conditions governing the master netting agreement, including the definition of fair value and the calculation of payments under the share swap instrument.","Does the document mention ""share swap"" as one of the types of transactions being referred to by the ISDA 2010 Fair Value Share Swap European Interdealer annex?"
